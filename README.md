### [SHADCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs)

- shadcn/ui is a set of beautifully-designed, accessible components and a code distribution platform. Works with your favorite frameworks and AI models. Open Source. Open Code.

- shadcn/ui is not a component library, it helps developers create and interact directly with pre-component generated by shadcn/ui. Instead of installing all components, you can generate components you want. All components are generated in [shadcn-ui](./src/components/shadcn-ui/)(defined by [components.json](./components.json))

- In my application, i use vite installation.
